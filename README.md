# Python-Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my Python Projects from Semester 1 of AP Computer Science Principles.
My first project is a Digital Scene. I worked on this project with two of my classmates and we created a scene of a farm and a little house on a sunny day. The project is simple, but is visually appealing and was fun to make.
My second project is a Mad Libs Generator. This project asks for 8 different things such as nouns, adjectives, etc. The generator then uses these things to create a story. The story is simple and the generator is very fun as you can put different words in that can make the story fun or boring.
My third project is a Name Generator Project. In this project, the generator asks many questions to narrow down options and ultimately determine what animal the person is like
